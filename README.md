# climate-change-dataviz-js
Visualize trends in Temperature Data with HTML, CSS and Javascript

This project was inspired by this course [How to Visualize Data with JavaScript
](https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-visualize-data-with-javascript).

I avoid using the `jQuery` library and just use vanilla Javascript.
